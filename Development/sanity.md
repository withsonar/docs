# Sanity

After following all the set up section, you can type `sanity start` in the `/studio` folder to start the studio locally.

Your Sanity Studio should be running on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

!!! Note
If you did not manually set up your project, the `projectId` in `/studio/sanity.json` will still be set to the HULL demo project. Make sure to update this before starting the studio, otherwise you will be denied access when trying to access your studio.
